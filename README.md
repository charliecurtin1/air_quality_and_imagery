# Visualizing air quality and imagery resulting from the Thomas Fire in December 2017

created by Charlie Curtin

The Thomas Fire occurred in Santa Barbara County in December 2017, covering an area of around 280,000 acres. This analysis will visualize the burn scar of the Thomas Fire using Landsat imagery and false color band combinations. We will also visualize the daily AQI index, a measure of air quality, for Santa Barbara County during a window of time that includes the Thomas Fire.
